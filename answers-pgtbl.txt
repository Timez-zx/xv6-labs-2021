1. Any kernel data can be accessed faster using this way, just build a page to store the data and map it to physical.
2. The answer is in exec.c, when execute a program, we alway use exec to make the environment for the program. One function of the exec is to
make the vm for the program, the page0 is "load the program in"(data and text). The page2 is  the stack, page1 can be assigned by data because
it is guard page for protestion. The last ones contain the heap and other struct.
